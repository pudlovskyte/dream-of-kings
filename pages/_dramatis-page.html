			<h2 class='-center'>Camarilla</h2>

			<p>A harsh prince rules upon his domain, holding the city in the iron grip of his clan. The unshakable king of the city holds an unassailable position, or so it seems to those not in the <span class=no-wrap>know—for</span> there is only so much pressure fellow kindred can take.</p>

			<p>Majority of the Sabbat cainites will be new arrivals, with certain goals for their shorter or longer term visits.</p>
			<p class=clanInfo>Available clans: <i>antitribu</i>, Lasombra, Tzimisce.</p>
