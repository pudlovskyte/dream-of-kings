			<p>A few words, before we start.</p>

			<h2>You will not win this game.</h2>

			<p>You cannot win this game, because it is not about the end. Only the journey matters. It is not about winning at all costs, it s not about cheeting the victory out of others. It is about losing with style, about telling a story and hearing the stories of others.
			It is, in the end, a game to be played. We play, because it brings us pleasure.</p>

			<h2>Everyone owes debts that need to be collected.</h2>

			<p>Your old benefactors will come demanding to repay the favors, while your own sparse suply of owed favors will have to be called in. All debs must be honored, even if they are unofficial, or even cross-sect promises. Such is the way of the Elders. Expect to be in debt to the person you hate the most.</p>

			<h2>You will be betrayed.</h2>

			<p>You will prove a traitor yourself. Expect division, mistrust and rampant paranoia. Expect a boon to be called that forces you to act in discord with your goals, your coterie, your clan, and your sect. Expect to be branded traitor and have your loyalties called into question.</p>

		<h1>Dramatis Personae</h1>

		<div>
			<h2>Camarilla</h2>

			<p>A harsh prince rules upon his domain, his clan holding the city in an iron grip. An unasailable position of an unshakable king of the city. Or so it might seem to those not in the know.</p>
			<p>Majority of the Camarilla kindred will be established locals, and will get an unfair advantage over the new arrivals.</p>

			<h2>Sabbat</h2>

			<p>A bishop fighting for the dream of freedom, with a small pack of like minded cainites. A supposed higher authority, aiming to destroy everything the pack built in the years before.</p>
			<p>Majority of the Sabbat cainites will be new arrivals, with certain goals for their shorter or longer term visits.</p>

			<h2>Autarkis</h2>

			<p>There is to be an awakening.</p>
			<p>We will allow a certain number of independents to be dragged into the local events.</p>

	<div class='groups-page page'>
		<div>
			<h1>Incentives for Groups</h1>

			<p>Players are encouraged to form groups. For Camarilla, the groups should be clan-based, whereas Sabbat should focus on forming packs.</p>
			<p>Every player starts as a Neonate. Every three players can nominate a single player for Ancillae position. This nomination is player based, and it is encouraged to choose more experienced players for such roles.</p>
			<p>The GM's will assign a couple Elders from the ranks of Ancillae.
			Elders will have less freedom ver their backstory and goals than others and will be able to decline the "promotion".</p>
			<p>Roogh estimate is of 9 player groups allows for 6 Neonates, 2 Ancillae and 1 Elder, but this might be subject to change.</p>

						<h3>PBM and Introductory Meetings</h3>
					</hgroup>
					<div class=date>Mid-September</div>
				</div>
				<p>We will arrange separate meetings for most of the Camarilla and Sabbat, to make introductions, answer questions and provide last second information about the city.
				During this period, declarations and PBM will be allowed, and players will be allowed a limited in-character interraction in their own groups. Establishing additional backstory with other players will also be allowed, but all of the meetings with other players will be considered as outside of game (or having taken place in the past), especially so with the arriving characters.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<div class=meta>
					<h2>Main Game</h2>
					<div class=date>Late September</div>
				</div>
				<p>This period includes two full weekends and a week between them. It's on Saturday, September 24 that all of the arrivals will come to Vilnius, and the game begins in earnest.</p>
				<p>From this moment, all bets are off, and any character is in danger of a Final Death.</p>

			<p>Send us an email (dreamofkings.vtm@gmail.com) with your priorities:</p>
			<p>Would you prefer Camarilla or Sabbat? We'd like for Camarilla and Sabbat to be roughly equal in terms of player numbers, so please specify if you would agree to play both sides. We will allow only a small amount of independents.</p>

			<p>Do you have a group of players you're planning to be collaborating with? If not, do you need help finding the contacts of other players?</p>
			<p>What clan or clans would you like to play? We will try to give everyone their first choice.</p>

		<div class=footnote>*Assamites are now a part of the Camarilla, and the Gangrel have en masse left the Ivory Tower, yet some members of these clans have elected to remain in their previous positions.</div>
