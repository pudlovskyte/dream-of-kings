		<p>There will be a few areas designated as roleplay‐only. Strive to keep everything in character at all times, and avoid these areas for any out‐of‐game activities.</p>
		<p>The areas will be revealed before the game starts, separately for each Sect, during the introductory meetings. Elders might be restricted to playing only in certain areas known to them, except in special cases.</p>
		<p>All combats should be handled outside these areas, unless specifically noted.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, the official play area is the whole city of Vilnius, during the nighttime on weekdays and anytime during weekends.</p>
