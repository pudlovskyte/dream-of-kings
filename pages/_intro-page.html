		<p>A few words, before we start.</p>

		<h2>You will not win this game</h2>

		<p>You cannot win this game, because it is not about the end. Only the journey matters. It is not about winning at all costs, it is not about cheating the victory out of others. It is about losing with style, about telling a story, and about hearing the stories of others.
		It is, in the end, a game to be played. We play, because it brings us pleasure.</p>

		<h2>Everyone owes debts that need to be collected</h2>

		<p>Your old benefactors will come demanding to repay the favors, while your own sparse supply of owed favors will have to be called in. All debts must be honored, all cross‐sect promises must be fulfilled, for such is the way of the Elders. Expect to be in debt to the person you hate the most, and shall you fail to stand by your word, you will forever be remembered as an oath‐breaker.</p>

		<h2>You will be betrayed</h2>

		<p>You will prove a traitor yourself. Expect division, mistrust and paranoia. Expect a boon to be called that forces you to act in discord with your goals, your coterie, your clan, and your sect. Expect to be branded traitor and have your loyalties called into question.</p>
