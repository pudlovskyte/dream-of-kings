					<h2>Prologue</h2>
					<div class=subheading>PBM and Introductory Meetings</div>
				</div>
				<div class=date>Mid-September</div>
			</div>
			<p>We will arrange separate meetings for most of the Camarilla and Sabbat, to make introductions, answer questions and provide last second information about the city.
			During this period, declarations and PBM will be allowed, and players will be allowed a limited in-character interraction in their own groups. Establishing additional backstory with other players will also be allowed, but all of the meetings with other players will be considered as outside of game (or having taken place in the past), especially so with the arriving characters.</p>

				<h2>Main Game</h2>
				<div class=date>Late September</div>
			</div>
			<p>This period includes two full weekends and a week between them. It's on Saturday, September 24 that all of the arrivals should come to Vilnius, and the game begins in earnest.</p>
			<p>From this moment, all bets are off, and any character is in danger of a Final Death.</p>
