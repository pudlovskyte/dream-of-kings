			<p>We will arrange separate meetings for most of the Camarilla and Sabbat to make introductions, answer questions, and provide last second information about the city.
			During this period, declarations and play by email will be allowed, and players can engage in limited in‚Äêcharacter interaction in their own groups. Establishing additional backstory with other players will be encouraged, but meetings with other players will be considered as outside the game (or having taken place in the past).</p>
