		<h1>Incentives for Groups</h1>

		<p>Players are encouraged to form groups. For Camarilla, the groups should be clan-based, whereas Sabbat should focus on forming packs.</p>
		<p>Every player starts as a Neonate. Every three players can nominate a single player for Ancillae position. This nomination is player based, and it is encouraged to choose more experienced players for such roles.</p>
		<p>The GM's will assign a couple Elders from the ranks of Ancillae.
		Elders will have less freedom ver their backstory and goals than others and will be able to decline the "promotion".</p>
		<p>Roogh estimate is of 9 player groups allows for 6 Neonates, 2 Ancillae and 1 Elder, but this might be subject to change.</p>
