		<h1>Incentives for Groups</h1>

		<p>Players are encouraged to form groups focusing on a particular common goal. For Camarilla, the groups should be clan‐based, whereas Sabbat should focus on forming packs. Every group will be contacted detailing their goals. A dialogue will follow in order to integrate player needs and wishes into the upcoming plot.</p>
		<p>Every player starts as a Neonate. Every three players can nominate a fourth player for Ancillae position. This nomination is player based, and it is encouraged to choose more experienced players for such roles, even across groups.</p>
		<p>The Game Masters will assign a couple Elders from the ranks of Ancillae.
		Elders will have less freedom for their backstory and goals, as well as other play limitations. It is permitted to decline the “promotion”.</p>
		<p>Currently, a 12 player group allows for 9 Neonates, 2 Ancillae and 1 Elder, but this is subject to change.</p>
