		<h1>Incentives for Groups</h1>

		<p>Players are encouraged to form into groups, focusing on a particular common goal. For Camarilla, the groups should be clan-based, whereas Sabbat should focus on forming packs. Every group will be contacted, detailing their goals and a dialogue will follow to establish their backstory and aims in order to integrate player wishes and needs of the upcoming plot.</p>
		<p>Every player starts as a Neonate. Every three players can nominate a fourth player for Ancillae position. This nomination is player based, and it is encouraged to choose more experienced players for such roles, even cross-group.</p>
		<p>The GM's will assign a couple Elders from the ranks of Ancillae.
		Elders will have less freedom for their backstory and goals, as well as other play limits. It is permitted to decline the "promotion".</p>
		<p>Currently, a 12 player group allows for 9 Neonates, 2 Ancillae and 1 Elder, but this is subject to change.</p>
